# Simon Game
Remember the pattern!

## About
The user is presented with a squence which has to be predicted correctly by the user. Each time he inputs the series of buttons, he hears a sound that corresponds to that particular button. For every correct sequence predicted by the user, the game shows the same series of buttons pressed along with an additional step. The user is notified for every wrong button pressed. The game resumes from the same level showing the sequence if it is played in the non-strict mode. If played in the strict mode, the game restarts at any random level. The user wins the game if he gets series a of 20 steps correctly. The user is notified of his victory and the game starts over.
